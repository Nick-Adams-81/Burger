# Burger App

This is the Burger homework, the goal of this app is to demonstrate 
what I have learned in the past couple of weeks about various technologies,
those technoligies are as foillows:

* handlebars 
* config files
* controllers
* database useage(MySQL)
* model usage
* css
* javascript
* servers

This project is my first deep dive into full stack programming, my main troubles 
came from the routing, and im still having problems with the concepts of ORM, it 
will come together I feel more time working on it will benifit me greatly.
